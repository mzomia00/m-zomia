# "Music x Web3.0 x Dev Protocol x Community".

There are many ways for fans to support music artists (composers, lyricists, musicians, singers, track makers, sound engineers, performers, etc.), such as listening to music streaming services, watching videos on YouTube, downloading / buying CDs, attending live performances, donating money, crowdfunding, fan clubs, and selling goods.

However, due to covid-19, music concerts, live performances, and festivals, where people gather, have been devastated, and the artists and music professionals involved in the artists' activities - who used to rely on them as a source of income - are now struggling.

In such a situation, μ-zomia will provide a way for the fan community to support artists on a "long-term" basis, rather than the "short-term" support that has been provided in the past.

This is also a proposal for all artists, whether major or independent, to continue a sustainable artist career.

In addition, with the exception of a handful of artists who have a stable income (for example, those who can sell music under their own name), it is difficult for the sound engineers, track makers, and performers who support the work behind the scenes to earn income under their own names.

  
  

μ-zomia is a platform for all artists involved in music to solve the above problems and receive equal support.

  

To achieve this, μ-zomia will utilize the [Dev Protocol](https://devprotocol.xyz/) blockchain technology.

  

The Dev Protocol's "staking" function allows supporters (fans) to deposit DEV tokens, a cryptographic asset, to the people being supported (music artists), and both parties will receive rewards.

  

The above system is already in operation at "[Stakes.social](https://stakes.social/)", an OSS (Open Source Software) support site, and some OSS have received up to 80 million yen in support through staking alone, which is different from donations.

  

We, μ-zomia, have changed the target to "people who are involved in music", and the fan community will support the artists in a symbiotic way. We will provide a new platform and community for such support.

  

We designed a platform that supports not just individual songs, individual works, or individual rights, but the "people" involved in music itself.

## Activities of μ-zomia

### Development of μ-zomia
 - Construction of an artist support platform using the Dev Protocol
 - Implementation of an approval function for those who wish to register as artists (identity verification using external OAuth)<br>
We will use Youtube accounts to authenticate artists who wish to register.<br>
This will allow not only artists who have released music under their own name, but also people from various industries involved in music production to obtain staking.

 
### Launching and managing communities
Creation and operation of a community site for music creators

### Expandability outside of OSS

In μ-zomia, an OSS project, we are considering providing only basic functions, but we ourselves will use this OSS to manage the platform and community.

In the process, we will implement a system called "Pull Up".

**What is Pull Up?**

Pull Up is a system that allows supported music artists to save fees when withdrawing their own rewards by making specific "shares".

**Specific shares: Thanks Share and Knowledge GiveAway**

 - "Thanks Share" is the act of sharing the status of staking on SNS with images with hashtags.
 - "Knowledge GiveAway" is an action to ask people to output their knowledge as a video or article.

Artists can receive rewards from their supporters for staking, but we are planning to set a certain fee for withdrawing the rewards. However, we are planning to set a certain fee for withdrawing the rewards. However, "Pull Up" is a system that can keep this fee low.

## The world view of μ-zomia ##

Artists involved in music are involved in a wide range of activities. While this is a wonderful artistic activity, it is also a fact that there is a line between fairness and transparency.

  

The name "μ-zomia" is derived from the first letter of the word "Music," "M" (also read as "Mu"). The name "μ-zomia" was coined by combining the first letter of the word "music," "M," and the word "zomia," which means people without borders.

  
  

I coined the word by combining "zomia," which means "people without borders," and "people without borders in music," and "people who transcend existing boundaries to form a new nation on their own.

  

The term "μ-zomia" is used to describe this kind of existence.

  
### "Freeing up the means for music creators to regain control. ###

In the age of Web 2.0, players have grown with the goal of "how to grow and control information". However, just as the idea of OSS has not disappeared, the idea of DIY among music creators has not disappeared either. Rather, the Web 3.0 era is full of opportunities for individual creators to connect directly with the global network.

  

The Museomia team is a team that has seen both the world of technology and the world of music. We have a lot of music creators as our best friends, friends, and acquaintances, and we are exposed to music every day.

  

In this environment, we thought about how we can provide the best support for music and people involved in music, and decided to arrange and provide the new network that is developing in Web 3.0 for music creators.

## Why the Dev Protocol? ##

In order to realize the world view of μ-zomia, the Dev Protocol was ideal.

We have already realized a system that allows us to support OSS based on someone else's profit on a decentralized protocol.

  

In addition, the way the Dev Protocol team works is highly accurate in realizing Web 3.0, which is the ideal form of a team for the future.

  

We agreed with all of their "technology," "team," and "vision," and made the decision to use Dev Protocol.

## Future development plans for μ-zomia ##

Implementation of the translation function
We will first implement English, and then we will implement an automatic translation function between English and Japanese for the community site.

## How we will use the funds raised by DEV ##

We will basically use the funds for the following 　

1. Development costs 　
2. Securing human resources (including support personnel)
3. Returning surplus profits to music artists (via Dev *μ-zomia will be staking)
