# m-zomia
Î¼-zomia is a project to support musicians and people involved in music production.  By utilizing the mechanism of the "Dev Protocol", which has already been released as a crypto asset to support OSS, musicians and music producers who are approved for registration will be able to earn staking rewards.  This project is unique in that it targets "people" for staking, shifting the relationship between music creators and those who support them from a "buying and selling relationship" to a "mutual support (symbiosis)" relationship.
