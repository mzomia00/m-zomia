# Add a New Market, YouTube to Dev Protocol

μ-zomia is a platform that enables sustainable funding for all the people involved in Music, by using Dev Protocol's staking system. It is currently under construction.

In μ-zomia, we would like to use the potential Creator's YouTube channel (YouTube account) as an external authentication and count when you register as a creator.

*stakes.social uses Github account for authentication. The music version of this.

I'd like to ask the Dev Protocol community if you think that this is a good idea or not.

## Summary

Add a YouTube channel market to the new Dev Protocol market. It allows music artists in μ-zomia, following OSS developers, to tokenize their works.

## Background and motivation

Since the μ-zomia project is aimed at "music people", it is necessary to make staking available to more people involved in music In this regard, we had initially planned to use Soundcloud accounts for authentication, but since Soundcloud accounts are only for people who are marketed as "artists," individuals in the following segments of the music industry would not be able to register.

### - Examples of music professionals who cannot be covered by Soundcloud accounts

Sound engineers, recording engineers, conductors, people who do not release music under their own name but work with music (backing chorus, orchestra members, voice trainers, etc.), music festival organizers, mixing technicians, and other "people who work with music.

At μ-zomia, we believe that world music is born not only from artists who genuinely release music, but also from the music professionals who support them. Therefore, we thought that it is necessary to clear the following points in the "account authentication" when constructing μ-zomia Dapp.

### Conditions for external authentication accounts in μ-zomia



* It should be easy to open an account.
* Proof of the contents of the activity must be possible.

As a result of considering external accounts that meet the above conditions, we think it is appropriate to implement authentication on YouTube channel (account) = add a new market in DevProtocol.

### Positive points



* Bigger potential market, involving all the people that work with music, not only just the Artist.
* More people involved in music can register to μ-zomia (more people can be staked & more people involved in music can be invited)
* Easier development for the much-anticipated "YouTubers" (with Dapp other than μ-zomia)
* When Dapps targeting "YouTubers" are planned in the future, users will be able to choose whether they want to invite staking as a "music category" or as a YouTuber (μ-zomia or Newbee).

### Negative points

If a Dapp targeting "Youtubers" is planned in the future, there is a possibility that some users will be duplicated.

From μ-zomia's point of view, it is possible for non-musicians to apply for registration with a YouTube account, so the account verification process will be necessary.

### Remarks

μ-zomia does not have any intention to monopolize the YouTuber market.

We just think that Youtube channel is suitable as an external account that can be created by "many music professionals".

## Development period

We expect to complete the development of the authentication function within a few weeks after the approval of this proposal.
